    <h1>My YouTube Channel</h1>
    <p>I made a YouTube channel a few months ago, and I am in need of subscribers. It would be great to make it to 1000 subscribers,
        and every subscriber counts.</p>
    <p>When you hit 1000 subscribers, YouTube reviews your channel, and then if everything is good, (no songs/movies/pictures
        without copyright info) they will approve your channel, and then ads will show up on your videos, and when they are
        clicked on or watched
        <b>completely</b>, you get paid about 15-25 cents per ad. You want as many subscribers as you can get, to maximize ad
        watches/clicks. You get banned if you click ads on
        <b>your own</b> channel</p>
    <p>My channel is mostly about
        <i>unicycles</i> and
        <i>Ripstiks</i>, but overall it is a
        <u>vlog</u> channel.</p>
